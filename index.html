                    <strong class="steam">Steam</strong> data on games and

                    We start by visualizating the release rate of the games by

                    We conducted a sampling process to curate a dataset
                    comprising the <strong>250 most reviewed games</strong> that
                    were released <strong>before the year 2019</strong>,
                    ensuring that each selected game possesses a minimum age of
                    five years. This criterion not only guarantees a diverse
                    representation of the gaming landscape but also focuses on
                    titles that have withstood the test of time.

                    To see what countries are producing more games, we make a
                    world choropleth map, where each country is shaded to show
                    the <strong>quantity of game development companies</strong>
